 # LittleTasks "Additional Functions Of Calendar"
 Writed a function:
 class Solution {
  public static int solution(int year, String firstMonth, String secondMonth, String firstDayInTheYear){
    }
  }
  
Assume that:
- "year" is an integer within the range [2,001..2,099];
- "firstMonth" and "secondMonth" are valid month names;
- month "secondMonth" does not preceed month "firstMonth";
- "firstDayInTheYear" is a valid name of a day of the week;
- "firstDayInTheYear" is the correct day of the week for January 1st of year "year"
